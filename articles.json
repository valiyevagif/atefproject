      "content": "Our product range includes oil distribution transformers up to 5,000 kVA and a voltage class of 52 kV.  According to the design, transformers are made hermetically sealed (HST), gas insulated (GIT), with flanges (TF) and an expansion tank (ETT).<br><br>At the request of the customer, regulation of the voltage can be both on load (with OLTC) and off load(OCTC). The windings of the transformers are made of aluminium or copper. On request, distribution transformers with low losses can be supplied.<br><br>Distribution transformer tanks are made of corrugated walls and have a protective coating on the epoxy base. Cold or hot galvanized is also possible for long-term operation of transformers in the coastal areas and on oil platforms. The annual production capacity is 5000 units."
